[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snakemake-workflows/prspipe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/snakemake-workflows/prspipe)

Snakemake pipeline to run Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) prediction. Implements and extends the [GenoPred](https://github.com/opain/GenoPred) pipeline, i.e. a reference standardized framework for the prediction of PRS using different state of the art methods.

## Authors

* Remo Monti & Sophie Wharrie
* [GenoPred](https://github.com/opain/GenoPred): Oliver Pain 

## Usage

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) repository and, if available, its DOI (see above).

### Step 1: Obtain a copy of this workflow

1. Create a new github repository using this workflow [as a template](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the newly created repository to your local system, into the place where you want to perform the data analysis.

### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the files in the `config/` folder. Adjust `config.yaml` to configure the workflow execution, and `samples.tsv` to specify your sample setup.

> Note: samples.tsv is currently disabled.

### Step 3: Install Snakemake and other dependencies

Install Snakemake using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html):

     conda create -c bioconda -c conda-forge -n snakemake snakemake
> Note: make sure to update conda, or use mamba to get the latest version of snakemake i.e. `6.2.1`

For installation details, see the [instructions in the Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

Run `download_resources.sh` and `install_software.sh` to set up software.

    bash ./download_resources.sh
    bash ./install_software.sh

Currently dependency management is left to the user (will change in the future). To run the setup scripts below, the user needs to have R available, and install the following dependencies:

    R
    install.packages('data.table','doMC','optparse','foreach','caret','ggplot2','cowplot','glmnet','MLmetrics','e1071','stringr')

### Step 4: Execute workflow

Activate the conda environment, and use `./run.sh` to launch snakemake with default parameters:

    conda activate snakemake
    # run all the setup rules (steps 1-3 of GenoPred)
    ./run.sh all_setup

See the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html) for further details (cluster execution, dependency handling etc.).

### Step 5: Investigate results

After successful execution, you can create a self-contained interactive HTML report with all results via:

    snakemake --report report.html

This report can, e.g., be forwarded to your collaborators.
An example (using some trivial test data) can be seen [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-kallisto-sleuth/master/.test/report.html).

### Step 6: Commit changes

Whenever you change something, don't forget to commit the changes back to your github copy of the repository:

    git commit -a
    git push

### Step 7: Obtain updates from upstream

Whenever you want to synchronize your workflow copy with new developments from upstream, do the following.

1. Once, register the upstream repository in your local copy: `git remote add -f upstream git@github.com:snakemake-workflows/prspipe.git` or `git remote add -f upstream https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/prspipe.git` if you do not have setup ssh keys.
2. Update the upstream version: `git fetch upstream`.
3. Create a diff with the current version: `git diff HEAD upstream/master workflow > upstream-changes.diff`.
4. Investigate the changes: `vim upstream-changes.diff`.
5. Apply the modified diff via: `git apply upstream-changes.diff`.
6. Carefully check whether you need to update the config files: `git diff HEAD upstream/master config`. If so, do it manually, and only where necessary, since you would otherwise likely overwrite your settings and samples.


### Step 8: Contribute back

In case you have also changed or added steps, please consider contributing them back to the original repository:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the original repo to a personal or lab account.
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the fork to your local system, to a different place than where you ran your analysis.
3. Copy the modified files from your analysis to the clone of your fork, e.g., `cp -r workflow path/to/fork`. Make sure to **not** accidentally copy config file contents or sample sheets. Instead, manually update the example config files if necessary.
4. Commit and push your changes to your fork.
5. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) against the original repository.

## Testing

Test cases are in the subfolder `.test`. They are automatically executed via continuous integration with [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
